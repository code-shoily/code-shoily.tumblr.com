                                    <h1>PHP: Emptying my Cup</h1>
                    <p>Yes, I have started to learn PHP. Those who know me might get surprised or even put a smug smirk on, but that&rsquo;s that. For the first time in my 14 years of knowing about the art of Programming, I am making an attempt to actually learn the language.</p>
<p>Being exposed to (and inspired by) Eric Raymonds&rsquo; writings from a very young age, I had developed this habit of collecting programming languages, at least one per year. In that journey, came (in chronological order), C#, Java, Python, JavaScript, Perl, Common Lisp, Scheme, Ruby, C++, C (that came late in my life), Clojure, Scala, and Go. Granted, of them, only Python, Clojure (and other Lisps here and now), and Java stuck. Now, it&rsquo;s PHP&rsquo;s turn to be learnt instead of having thrust upon.</p>
<p>I never really &ldquo;learnt&rdquo; PHP, I had always been force-fed it. It was at my first, second and partially the third work-places. My fellow colleagues (and from now on, I shall remember NEVER to talk about my first and second work-places) weren&rsquo;t as proficient in the language to have me inspired to show me the friendlier path of doing things. I ended up being bitter, and having to regularly view messy and unmanaged code, upset and hateful towards the tool, instead of understanding the shortcomings of the workmen (me included, Google had always been there at my disposal). As a result, my posts, comments, and statuses had always been against the language, at times in mockery, at others, in criticism. One fact remained however, I had never &ldquo;learnt&rdquo; the language, not in the way I had &ldquo;learnt&rdquo; 14 others, while if I have forgotten most- I did make attempts, with no pressures or promises. Reading posts in /r/lolphp or articles tagged &ldquo;PHP Sucks&rdquo; is hardly educational. And to hurt someones toolkit that facilitates the creation of something, and been so for decades is hardly respectful. So, that stage stops from here. Sorry guys.</p>
<p>Recently, I have been getting some pro-PHP articles and after a recent DevCon, I got some pointers towards what PHP has become (and also, saw for the first time PHP in the eyes of its worthy admirers). That got me wondering, a language may have its deficiencies, bad design decisions, or decisions conflicting with the mindset of a certain set of people; it is true for any tool, JavaScript suffers from it badly, as does, to a certain few, Objective-C, but those still remained staple (Although I hope Swift does something to Objective-C&rsquo;s semi-monopoly, it is a bad habit Apple needs to kick). PHP is no different, whether it is more or less prone to design specific idiosyncracies is not my place to judge, as long as I know I can create with it through avoiding it, and promote it to others so that they do the same. This last statement actually motivated me to learn PHP.</p>
<p>I am not saying I am a good programmer, I am just a person who took &ldquo;Learn a programming language per year&rdquo; too seriously. And wherever I look, I see people being interested in PHP or its toolkits. Shoving Python or Ruby onto their face is not an answer. Shoving programming in general is, and if the vessel therein is PHP, it&rsquo;s well and good, because PHP done right can yield greatness just as the way Python done right can, the converse is also true, it may be that in case of PHP it becomes truer at times, but it is also true that there are way more PHP programmers than any other, if you bring varying skill-set and non-programming background into account. And I recently felt, since I collect one language per year any way, why not make an attempt to minimize it and fetch good stuff both into my skill-set and to certain others, if I can.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have to write a whole blog post to justify my learning PHP, since as far as I know, few (Non-PHP-Lang)-to-PHP converts exist. And this is by no means a mean to make myself convinced to start all this. But this is my way of doing something vocal and positively so about PHP. This is about emptying my cup and starting to learn a skill, only this time, a skill that is already spread and enjoy a great community to learn from and owning an opportunity to give something back instead of partially educated criticism. Perhaps I might shed light on this piece of technology from a different perspective, given my background (Empty cup, eh?). Let time tell that.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong>Â I shall be posting about my learnings on a regular basis and perhaps be bugging the people I know, a lot maybe. I know, they wouldn&rsquo;t mind. Also, my promise about writing a tutorialish post about DRF + Restangular + Good intentions still exist. I still love Python and nothing will change that.</p>
